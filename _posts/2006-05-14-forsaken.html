<p>Skillet - Forsaken (Lyrics)</p>
<p>I recall going madly in love with you<br/>And I remember this<br/>How could I forget?<br/>Regret is a needle<br/>In my neck<br/>It's slowly filling me<br/>With poison<br/>Spreading to my chest<br/><br/>Take my pain and numb me from this<br/><br/>Why do I have to beg<br/>When all that's left<br/>Is a memory<br/>Forsaken [2x]<br/><br/>I recall pledging my sole devotion to you<br/>It reminds me how<br/>Now I'm on my knees<br/>My guilt consumes<br/>Lost the will in me<br/>Wasting away before you<br/>Hold me closer please<br/><br/></p>
<p>No, it's not the whole song, it's most of it though (it repeats a lot :p). I guess parts of this song go on a lot about my last post (about forgiveness)</p>
<p>Seems the write of the song did something wrong, that they're struggling with, and they're so torn by what they've done the feel they really need to beg for forgiveness.  "Regret is a needle inside my neck" - shows how bad things can really get with regret.</p>
<p>But the big part of it: "Why do we have to beg when all that's left is a memory?". I'm supposing that's why sins are so easily forgiven - because that's all they are; a memory.</p>
<p>Just a nice little though exercise :o)</p>
