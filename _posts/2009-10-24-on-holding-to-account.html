<p>The other day, Paula and I went to the youth bible study, which we've been helping to lead over the past couple of weeks. This week, our Pastor was there and the idea of the study was to hold some of the youth leaders to account - we basically went through 1 Tim 3, which defines some attributes that a leader must have, and talked about each point.</p>
<p>Now, it seems that some or more of the potential youth leaders haven't particularly been living up to these ideals, but what I found most interesting was the Pastor's struggle with telling the youth leaders that.</p>
<p>You see, he said that 2 verses had come to mind when doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%204:17a&version=NIV">1 Pet 4:17</a>: It is time for judgement to begin in the house of God [...]</li>
<li><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A3-5&version=NIV">Matt 7:5</a>: [...] First, take the plank from your own eye [...]</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren't particularly surprising - generally they're at the forefront of most people's mind when they feel moved to point out errors in people, especially the 2nd one. What was most surprising though was the conviction and emotion which the Pastor displayed when he was telling the kids. It was the most gracious, moving and heartfelt admonition I've ever seen, and probably ever will. He was quite distraught at the prospect of being a 'judge', because he knew that he wasn't necessarily better.</p>
<p>It made me think, you know - whenever I'm pointing out sin in others (which isn't very often, really), why do I it? Is it with pride or humility? Do I think I'm better than them? Do I even have a right at all to admonish anyone at all? When I'm being held to account, do I ever think "You're no better yourself, you have no right to judge me"?</p>
