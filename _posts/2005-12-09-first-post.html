<p> Well, I figure it's about time I wrote something in here to fill the void - 	    I'm sure most you are quite bored with seeing a huge list of "lying down" dudes,		though truth be told, I never tire of them.</p>
<p> As you can probably tell, the site has been updated a little.  Layout wise.  hopefully		by the time you're reading this, I've done the gallery section decently enough and		well, other stuff too.</p>
<p> Uhh, I dislike Internet Explorer.  It messes everything up... simple as this site looks		(and indeed, is), it took *ages* to line everything up properly.  I can only pray it		looks half decent on safari and opera, the only other 2 browsers that matter.  Drop me		a comment if it doesn't show right.  Oh, and if you can think of a better colour scheme,		which shouldn't be hard - a colourblind penguin could come up with a better colour scheme		methinks - also drop a comment in, or contact me.  Y'all know how to.  Feedback is appreciated.</p>
<p> Anyway, this'll do for now.  Next major update will include *gasp* a FORUM! (and better layout for gallery...)</p>
