<p> Well, I figure it's about time I wrote something in here to fill the void - I'm sure most you are quite bored with seeing a huge list of "lying down" dudes, though truth be told, I never tire of them.</p>

<!--break-->
<p> As you can probably tell, the site has been updated a little. Layout wise. hopefully by the time you're reading this, I've done the gallery section decently enough and well, other stuff too.</p>
<p> Uhh, I dislike Internet Explorer. It messes everything up... simple as this site looks (and indeed, is), it took *ages* to line everything up properly.
    I can only pray it looks half decent on safari and opera, the only other 2 browsers that matter. Drop me a comment if it doesn't show right.
    Oh, and if you can think of a better colour scheme, which shouldn't be hard - a colourblind penguin could come up with a better colour scheme methinks - also drop a comment in, or contact me. Y'all know
    how to. Feedback is appreciated.</p>
<p> Anyway, this'll do for now. Next major update will include *gasp* a FORUM! (and better layout for gallery...)</p>
