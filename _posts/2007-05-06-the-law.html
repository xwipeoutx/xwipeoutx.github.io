<p>People in the car on the way to SNL today need not worry about reading any more :) But for those who are still with me...</p>

<!--break-->
<p>I was reading the glossary in the back of my bible yesterday, and I came across "cornerstone": Either the bottom corner of a building (a foundation stone) or the keystone of an archway (Mark 12:10). It can cause a person to stuble (1 Peter 2:8) or it can fall on someone (Matt 21:44).</p>
<p>For completeness:<br />
<b>1 Peter 2:8</b> - A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall."<u>[a]</u> They stumble because they disobey the message â€” which is also what they were destined for.<br />
<b><u>[a]</u> Isaiah 8:14</b> - and he will be a sanctuary;<br />
       but for both houses of Israel he will be<br />
       a stone that causes men to stumble<br />
       and a rock that makes them fall.<br />
       And for the people of Jerusalem he will be<br />
       a trap and a snare.<br />
<b>Matt 21:44</b> - He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.</p>
<p>So, that's the bible verses out of the way =D It's strange on how many people depict a cornerstone as a very <a href="http://www.christianlyricsonline.com/artists/day-of-fire/cornerstone.html">positive thing</a> - interpretting the cornerstone as the essential building block, something everyone can lean on - the solid rock that is Jesus.</p>
<p>But I'm looking at these verses, and it depicts the cornerstone as being very...well...wrathful.  It really jumps out at me how much Jesus is the Judge and a physical embodiment of the Law. And like <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:7-10;&version=31;">Paul</a> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202:17-24;&version=31;">points</a> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:19-20;&version=31;">out</a> several times in Romans (and there's more, trust me :p I just had a search), it's only because of the Law that we can be called sinners.  If there was no definition of right, how can we be called wrong?</p>
<p>So there...next time you hear people singing about Jesus being our cornerstone: remember that by being our cornerstone, Jesus is pointing out to all of us that we fall short of His glory, and don't hold to the law.  But because of that, we will cling to him even harder, because we know how much we need Him.</p>
<p>That being put aside, I have a rant: Christians - don't break the law when you drive! Moreso than any other, we need to be upright and faultless when being judged by the world. Read <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2013;&version=31;">Romans 13</a> if you don't believe me.  Jim (from Student Life) said how a bunch of policeman would always wait at a particular road during Christian camps, and book them all for speeding. BE BLAMELESS! We're told we should be persecuted, but not for driving.  Only for our faith.  Please drive to the law!</p>
