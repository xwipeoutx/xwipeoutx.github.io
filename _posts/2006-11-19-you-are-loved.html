<p>I think everyone needs to focus much more on loving others, and much less on being loved.  And yes, the reason this post is going up on my blog is because I realised it's something that needs to come true in my life, too.  <small>Let's see if anyone can guess what specifically...</small></p>
<p>I think Rebecca St James said it best<br />
<blockquote>You are loved, more than you can imagine.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, let's stop relying on the love of others, because we have God's love, which is more than we can imagine.  The only thing left is to love others.</p>
