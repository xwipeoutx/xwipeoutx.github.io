So, it seems I've bitten the bullet - being so close to the core (working straight from DirectX, and using no wrapper libraries besides what I create myself) has finally done me in. While I know can get the project working continuing on with my current engine, it doesn't seem very efficient for me to do so.</p>

<p>
For example, for me to get shadows working on my project, it took several days of coding (I was trying out an omni-directional shadow mapping technique). To get it working in <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Ogre 3D</a>, it took 5secs - a call to <b>setShadowTechnique</b>, and then a call <b>setCastShadows(true)</b> for each node I want to cast a shadow. Simple! Time saving!</p>

So in order to be able to get results in the project in a timely fashion, I'll be porting all my code over to another engine. At the moment, I'm erring towards Ogre3D - the only drawback is it's graphics only, not sound/input/network/physics as well. But it has a nice plugin system, and can apparently support things like PhysX quite nicely. I was going to use Torque, but it costs money, and I don't too much of that lying around for something that I don't even have example code for to see how good it is...</p>
