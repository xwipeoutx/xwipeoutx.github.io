<p>So, here I am, worried about this exam on Monday - many things make it seem impossible for me.  Was a great opportunity to pull open my 33.33% Holy Spirit source of Goodness and see what He has to say. </p>

<p>I'm going to share each and every time I do it with y'all who bother reading this, aren't ya lucky? Even though you've probably read them already, it'll be nice to know the context in which they all came out</p>
<blockquote><p>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty.  I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.</p></blockquote>
<p>It becomes immediately obvious that Paula didn't type it, because it is all spelt right ^_^ Haha! But I guess what this has to show me is that, even though I probably feel like I'm going to fail I (a) should be content, even if I do and (b) shouldn't be worried, because I <i>can</i> do this exam, through Christ.
<p>Thanks, whoever did this one!</p>
